		A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components. The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it is called the solvent. The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent is called the solute. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called a dilute or concentrated; a saturated or unsaturated solution. A solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution. The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. 
		<br>A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture. Molecule sizes of colloids are from 1 nanometer to 1 micrometre. The different substances in a colloid can be disconnected by a centrifuge. The size of particles of a colloid is too small to be individually seen by naked eyes. Colloids are big enough to scatter a beam of light passing through them and make its path visible. A colloid is stable. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium. Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye. The particles of a suspension scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. The solute particles settle down when a suspension is left undisturbed, that is, a suspension is unstable. They can be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration.
