		A mixture contains more than one substance (element and/ or compound) mixed in any proportion. Mixtures can be separated into pure substances using appropriate separation techniques. A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The major component of a solution is called the solvent, and the minor is the solute. The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute present per unit volume or per unit mass of the solution. Materials that are insoluble in a solvent and have particles that are visible to naked eyes, form a suspension. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture. Colloids are heterogeneous mixtures in which the particle size is too small to be seen with the naked eye, but is big enough to scatter light. Colloids are useful in industry and daily life. The particles are called the dispersed phase and the medium in which they are distributed is called the dispersion medium.
		<br>There are several types of separation techniques that are used in segregating a mixture of substances. As for the need for separation, it is usually done to remove all the unwanted materials and obtain useful components. Some of the common methods of separating substances or mixtures are Crystallization, Filtration, Decantation, Sublimation, Evaporation, Simple distillation, Fractional distillation, Chromatography, Centrifugation, Magnetic separation, and Precipitation. Thus, by choosing one of the methods according to the nature of the components of a mixture, we get a pure substance.
