		Poverty has many dimensions. Normally, this is measured through the concept of “poverty line”. Through this concept, we analysed the main global and national trends in poverty. But in recent years, analysis of poverty is becoming rich through a variety of new concepts like social exclusion. Similarly, the challenge is becoming bigger as scholars are broadening the concept of human poverty.
		<br>Poverty has certainly declined in India. But despite the progress, poverty reduction remains India’s most compelling challenge. Wide disparities in poverty are visible between rural and urban areas and among different states. Certain social and economic groups are more vulnerable to poverty. Poverty reduction is expected to make better progress in the next ten to fifteen years. This would be possible mainly due to higher economic growth, increasing stress on universal free elementary education, declining population growth, and increasing empowerment of the women and the economically weaker sections of society.  
		<br>The official definition of poverty, however, captures only a limited part of what poverty really means to people. It is about a “minimum” subsistence level of living rather than a “reasonable” level of living. Many scholars advocate that we must broaden the concept of human poverty. A large number of people may have been able to feed themselves. But do they have education? Or shelter? Or health care? Are they free from caste and gender discrimination? Is the practice of child labour still common?
