		As per the Annual report of the Pay Research Unit of the Department of Expenditure, as on 01.03.2018, there are 683823 posts lying vacant. Vacancies in the Central Government are caused due to retirement, resignation, death promotion etc. and the posts falling vacant are required to be filled as per recruitment rules by the concerned Ministries/ Departments/ Organisations. Filling up vacant posts is a continuous process depending on the vacancies arising across Ministries/Departments during the year and the action calendar of the recruiting agencies.
		<br>Recruitment against vacant posts is a continuous process. By the time vacancies reported by a Department get filled up, some new vacancies arise. Where a post remains vacant for more than two years/three years, the same becomes "deemed abolished" as per Department of Expenditure OM No. 7(1)/E‐Coord‐I/2007 dated 12.04.2017. Such posts are revived based on functional justification. There is no system of abolishing posts in the Railways. DOPT issues instructions from time to time for timely and advance action to fill up the vacant posts. Recently, all Ministries/Departments have been requested to take time-bound action to fill the existing vacancies in various Ministries/Departments.
		<br>To reduce the recruitment cycle, recruiting agencies have switched over to computer-based online test, interview for non‐gazetted posts has been discontinued and provisional appointment is being made pending verification of antecedents of the candidates.
