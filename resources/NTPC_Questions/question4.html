		Since poverty has many facets, social scientists look at it through a variety of indicators. Usually, the indicators are used to relate to the levels of income and consumption. But now poverty is looked at through other social indicators like illiteracy level, lack of general resistance due to malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, lack of job opportunities, lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation etc. Analysis of poverty based on social exclusion and vulnerability is now becoming very common.
		<br>According to social exclusion, poverty must be seen in terms of the poor having to live only in a poor surrounding with other poor people, excluded from enjoying social equality of better-off people in better surroundings. Broadly, it is a process through which individuals or groups are excluded from facilities, benefits and opportunities that others enjoy. A typical example is the working of the caste system in India in which people belonging to certain castes are excluded from equal opportunities. Social exclusion thus may lead to but can cause more damage than, having a very low income.
		<br>Vulnerability to poverty is a measure, which describes the greater probability of certain communities or individuals (such as a widow or a physically handicapped person) of becoming, or remaining, poor in the coming years. Vulnerability is determined by the options available to different communities for finding an alternative living in terms of assets, education, health and job opportunities.
