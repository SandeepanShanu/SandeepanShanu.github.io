			The environment is a key determinant of social and individual
		health. You may be aware that many of our health problems are caused
		by environmental degradation. Exposure to air, water and soil pollution,
		chemicals in the environment, or noise, can cause cancer, respiratory,
		cardiovascular and communicable diseases, as well as some other
		serious health disorders. Although environmental degradation can affect
		the health of the whole population, some groups are particularly
		vulnerable, including children, pregnant women, the elderly and persons
		with pre existing family history of certain diseases.
	<br><br>
			As you are aware that number of factors contribute to
		environmental degradation, but the most important factor is the misuse
		and over use of natural resources. All that the nature has provided to us
		such as soil, air, water, minerals, sunshine (sunlight), animals and plants,
		etc., are known as natural resources. Human beings use these directly or
		indirectly for their survival and welfare. The problem lies in how these
		natural resources are distributed and used. If at any time one person or a
		group of people uses more than their fair share of resources, an
		imbalance is created. This leads to environmental health problems for
		others.
	<br><br>
			It is, therefore, essential for every individual to ensure that natural
		resources are protected and are not misused or over used, so that social
		and individual health is not affected adversely. In India, we have had a
		great tradition of environmental conservation. We have been taught
		since ages to respect nature and to recognize that all forms of life -
		human, animal and plant are closely interrelated. Disturbance in one
		gives rise to an imbalance in others. Our Constitution also has provisions
		for protection of environment.
	<br><br>
			Natural resources can be protected in two ways. Efforts are needed
		to ensure that natural resources are used judiciously according to the
		needs of the present generation, and of future generations. Secondly,
		care needs to be taken so that natural resources are properly maintained
		and sustained.
