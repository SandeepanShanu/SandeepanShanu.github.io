			Let us understand what is growth? Growth may be defined as the 
		quantitative increase in size or mass. When weight is measured in 
		kilograms and height in centimeters from time to time, we can know 
		how much growth has occurred in a child. When the organs of the body 
		grow, the number, the size and the weight of their cells increase. Growth 
		can be measured in terms of the change in length, width, depth and 
		volume in a specific time period. Although growth is a characteristic of 
		living beings, in all living beings, the rate of growth also depends on 
		nutrition and living conditions, including the environment at home.

			Growth, development and maturation occur side by side. Growth 
		is a quantitative increase in size through increase in number of cells or 
		elongation of cells. Development may be defined as the progression of 
		changes, both qualitative and quantitative, which lead to an 
		undifferentiated mass of cells to a highly organized state. Maturation is a 
		measure of functional capacity. For example, a child begins to speak by 
		making unintelligible sounds. Then, slowly it acquires the capacity for 
		speaking in a manner, which is easily understood by others. Another 
		example of maturation is when a child begins to crawl and then matures 
		to a state of walking on two legs. Similarly, organs of reproduction reach 
		maturity at the end of puberty. Although age related events of growth, 
		development and maturation in human beings are mostly the same in all 
		cultures, however, some variations do exist. This is because growth is 
		affected by both genetic and the environmental factors. Growth is also 
		influenced by the socio cultural context. For example, in the 
		economically backward families, the growth of family members gets 
		stunted due to undernourishment. But even in economically sound 
		households, the members may not be taking a nutritious diet. Many 
		children who eat junk food all the time become obese. In fact, growth 
		and development of a human being is a result of a combination of 
		heredity and environment.
