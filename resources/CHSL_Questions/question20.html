		Life on Earth depends on resources like soil, water and air, and energy from the Sun. Uneven heating of air over land and water-bodies causes winds. Evaporation of water from water-bodies and subsequent condensation give us rain. Rainfall patterns depend on the prevailing wind patterns in an area. Various nutrients are used again and again in a cyclic fashion. This leads to a certain balance between the various components of the biosphere. Pollution of air, water and soil affect the quality of life and harm the biodiversity. We need to conserve our natural resources and use them in a sustainable manner.
		There are several nutrients essential for crops. Of these, some are required in large quantities and are known as macro-nutrients whereas rest of the nutrients are required in small quantities and are known as micro-nutrients. Manure and fertilizers are the main sources of nutrient supply to crops. Organic farming is a farming system with minimal or no use of chemicals as fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc. and with a maximum input of organic manures, recyled farm wastes, and bio-agents, with healthy cropping systems. Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land. Growing two or more crops in definite row patterns is known as inter-cropping. The growing of different crops on a piece of land in pre-planned succession is called crop rotation. Varietal improvement is required for higher yield, good quality, biotic and abiotic resistance, shortening the maturity duration, wider adaptability and desirable agronomic characteristics. Farm animals require proper care and management such as shelter, feeding, breeding and disease control. This is called animal husbandry. Poultry farming is done to raise domestic fowls.
