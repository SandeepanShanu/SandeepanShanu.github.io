		Motion is a change of position; it can be described in terms of the distance moved or the displacement. The motion of an object could be uniform or non-uniform depending on whether its velocity is constant or changing. The speed of an object is the distance covered per unit time, and velocity is the displacement per unit time. The acceleration of an object is the change in velocity per unit time. Uniform and non-uniform motions of objects can be shown through graphs. The motion of an object moving at uniform acceleration can be described with the help of the equations. If an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its motion is called uniform circular motion.
		First law of motion: An object continues to be in a state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their state of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia. The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia. Force of friction always opposes motion of objects. Second law of motion: The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force. The unit of force is known as newton and represented by the symbol N. The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity. Third law of motion: To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction and they act on two different bodies. In an isolated system, where there is no external force, the total momentum remains conserved.
		All conservation laws such as conservation of momentum, energy, angular momentum, charge etc. are considered to be fundamental laws in physics. These are based on observations and experiments.
