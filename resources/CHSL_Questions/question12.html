			The existence of different kinds of matter is due to different atoms
		constituting them. Now the questions arise: What makes the atom of one
		element different from the atom of another element? Are atoms really
		indivisible, as proposed by Dalton, or are there smaller constituents
		inside the atom? We will learn about sub-atomic particles and the
		various models that have been proposed to explain how these particles
		are arranged within the atom.

			Credit for the discovery of electron and proton goes to J.J.
		Thomson and E. Goldstein, respectively. J.J. Thomson proposed that
		electrons are embedded in a positive sphere. Rutherford’s alpha-particle
		scattering experiment led to the discovery of the atomic nucleus.
		Rutherford’s model of the atom proposed that a very tiny nucleus is
		present inside the atom and electrons revolve around this nucleus. The
		stability of the atom could not be explained by this model. Niels Bohr’s
		model of the atom was more successful. He proposed that electrons are
		distributed in different shells with discrete energy around the nucleus. If
		the atomic shells are complete, then the atom will be stable and less
		reactive. J. Chadwick discovered presence of neutrons in the nucleus of
		an atom. So, the three sub-atomic particles of an atom are: electrons,
		protons and neutrons. Electrons are negatively charged, protons are
		positively charged and neutrons have no charges. The mass of an
		electron is about 0.0005 of the mass of a hydrogen atom. The mass of a
		proton and a neutron is taken as one unit each. Shells of an atom are
		designated as K, L, M, N, etc. Valency is the combining capacity of an
		atom. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of
		protons in the nucleus of its atom. The mass number of an atom is equal
		to the number of nucleons in its nucleus. Isotopes are atoms of the same
		element, which have different mass numbers. Isobars are atoms having
		the same mass number but different atomic numbers. Elements are
		defined by the number of protons they possess.
