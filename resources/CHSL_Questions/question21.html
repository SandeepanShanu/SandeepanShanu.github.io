			As defined by World Health Organization (WHO), health is “a 
		state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely 
		an absence of disease or infirmity". While illness and disease are at 
		times used interchangeably, these in fact, are different from each other. 
		Disease refers to a biomedically defined deviation from norms of body 
		function or structure, whereas, illness is the experience of this deviation.
		However, it is not appropriate to conclude that any one being merely 
		free from illness or disease is healthy.

			Let us understand how communicable diseases are spread. These 
		diseases are caused by certain infectious agents which may be bacteria 
		or viruses. These are capable of being transmitted from person to person 
		or from the environment to person.
	<br><br>
			The modes of transmission can be classified as direct and indirect 
		transmission. As we have studied in our earlier classes, direct 
		transmission of diseases takes place as Direct contact or touching;
		Droplet infection; Contact with soil; Inoculation into skin or mucosa;
		etc. Communicable diseases are also transmitted indirectly in the 
		following ways that are popularly known as ‘5Fs’- flies, fingers, fomites 
		(material capable of carrying infections, like towels, handkerchiefs etc.), 
		food and fluid. Some diseases are spread through water, food, ice, blood 
		and body tissues and organs. For example, typhoid, diarrhea, polio, 
		intestinal parasites and infective hepatitis. Flies contaminate food and 
		other eatables.
	<br><br>
			The measures help in prevention and control the spread of 
		communicable diseases are Food and water hygiene, Environmental 
		sanitation Vaccines, Treatment of diseases using medicines, Isolation of 
		patients with communicable diseases, It is important to make people 
		aware about communicable diseases, their causes and modes of spread. 
		People should also be made aware of their responsibilities towards 
		control of communicable diseases, e.g. ensuring use of safe water, 
		healthy food and proper management of garbage and waste disposal.
