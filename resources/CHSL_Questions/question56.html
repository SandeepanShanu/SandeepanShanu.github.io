			Suppose your family owns a plot of land and there is no fencing 
		around it. Your neighbour decides one day to fence off his land. After he 
		has fenced his land, you discover that a part of your familyâ€™s land has 
		been enclosed by his fence. How will you prove to your neighbour that 
		he has tried to encroach on your land? Your first step may be to seek the 
		help of the village elders to sort out the difference in boundaries. But, 
		suppose opinion is divided among the elders. Some feel you are right 
		and others feel your neighbour is right. What can you do? Your only 
		option is to find a way of establishing your claim for the boundaries of 
		your land that is acceptable to all. For example, a government approved 
		survey map of your village can be used, if necessary in a court of law, to 
		prove (claim) that you are correct and your neighbour is wrong.

			Let us look at another situation. Suppose your mother has paid the 
		electricity bill of your house for the month of August, 2005. The bill for 
		September, 2005, however, claims that the bill for August has not been 
		paid. How will you disprove the claim made by the electricity 
		department? You will have to produce a receipt proving that your 
		August bill has been paid.

			You have just seen some examples that show that in our daily life 
		we are often called upon to prove that a certain statement or claim is true 
		or false. However, we also accept many statements without bothering to 
		prove them. But, in mathematics we only accept a statement as true or 
		false (except for some axioms) if it has been proved to be so, according 
		to the logic of mathematics.
	<br><br>
			In fact, proofs in mathematics have been in existence for 
		thousands of years, and they are central to any branch of mathematics. 
		The first known proof is believed to have been given by the Greek 
		philosopher and mathematician Thales. While mathematics was central 
		to many ancient civilisations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India, 
		there is no clear evidence that they used proofs the way we do today.
