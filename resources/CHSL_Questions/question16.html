			In the previous exercises, we have learnt about the motion of 
		objects and force as the cause of motion. We have learnt that a force is 
		needed to change the speed or the direction of motion of an object. We 
		always observe that an object dropped from a height falls towards the 
		earth. We know that all the planets go around the Sun. The moon goes 
		around the earth. In all these cases, there must be some force acting on 
		the objects, the planets and on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp that 
		the same force is responsible for all these. This force is called the 
		gravitational force. In this chapter we shall learn about gravitation and 
		the universal law of gravitation. We shall discuss the motion of objects 
		under the influence of gravitational force on the earth. We shall study 
		how the weight of a body varies from place to place. We shall also 
		discuss the conditions for objects to float in liquids.

			The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction between 
		any two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and 
		inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The 
		law applies to objects anywhere in the universe. Such a law is said to be 
		universal. The law is universal in the sense that it is applicable to all 
		bodies, whether the bodies are big or small, whether they are celestial or 
		terrestrial Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved. 
		The force of gravity decreases with altitude. It also varies on the surface 
		of the earth, decreasing from poles to the equator. The weight of a body 
		is the force with which the earth attracts it. The weight is equal to the 
		product of mass and acceleration due to gravity. The weight may vary 
		from place to place but the mass stays constant.

			All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are 
		immersed in a fluid. Objects having density less than that of the liquid in 
		which they are immersed, float on the surface of the liquid. If the density 
		of the object is more than the density of the liquid in which it is 
		immersed then it sinks in the liquid.
