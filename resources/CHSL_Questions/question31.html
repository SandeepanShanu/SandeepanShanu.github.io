			Before discussing various dimensions of sports ethics, it is
		important to understand the meaning of ethics. Ethics, morals and values
		are used interchangeably in everyday language, though these terms are
		not synonyms. The concept of ethics is technically understood as a
		branch of philosophy that defines what is good for the individual and
		society and establishes the nature of obligations, or duties, that people
		owe themselves and to one another. But without going into the
		complexities of this concept, it is relevant to understand ethics as the
		practice of making principled choices between right and wrong: a code
		of conduct that guides human behaviour, a set of standards that guides
		our conduct. It is generally viewed as the system or set of rules, norms or
		laws by which attitudes and actions are determined to be either “right or
		wrong”. The fundamental problem of ethics is determining what
		constitutes proper conduct. It defines how individuals, professionals in
		different fields, organisations, associations, federation and corporations
		choose to interact with one another.
	<br><br>
			In view of the above, sports ethics is a positive concept that guides
		human action in sports. It is defined as the code of conduct for
		promoting and ensuring healthy sporting practices. Sports ethics
		signifies not just a certain form of behaviour but also a particular way of
		thinking. It promotes fair play among children and young persons via
		educational and preventive measures and encourages the dissemination
		of good practices to promote diversity in sport and combat all forms of
		discrimination.
	<br><br>
			Every child and young person has the right to play sport and
		games to gain satisfaction from the experience. The code of sports ethics
		applies to all levels of skills and commitment, recreational activities as
		well as competitive sport. It involves the elimination of all types of
		negative behaviour on and off the field. More importantly, it promotes
		equity and sporting excellence. Sports ethics is also focused on equity in
		sport which should be an expression of human excellence.
