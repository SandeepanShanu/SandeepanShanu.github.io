		to curing the diseases. The treatment under Ayurveda can be 
		successfully used in early stages of diabetes, liver-disorders, skin

			Both Homeopathy and Unani systems of medicine are also used in 
		the treatment of non communicable diseases. Homeopathy is that system 
		of medicine which is based on the nature’s law of cure. It is a safe and 
		effective method of treatment. It helps in increasing the immunity of the 
		body and offers in many cases a long lasting cure. Unani system of 
		medicine is also the natural way of treatment with the help of herbal 
		medicines. According to this system, the health of a person depends on 
		the balance of four elements in the body. These are Dam (blood), 
		Balgham (phlegm), Safra (yellow bile), and Sanda (black bile). The 
		Unani medicines are given to the person suffering from a disease to 
		promote an equilibrium of these elements in the body.
