		In the 1970s, food security was understood as the “availability at all times of adequate supply of basic foodstuffs”. Amartya Sen added a new dimension to food security and emphasised the “access” to food through what he called ‘entitlements’- a combination of what one can produce, exchange in the market alongwith state or other socially provided supplies. In 1995 World Food Summit declared, “Food security at the individual, household, regional, national and global levels exists en all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”.
		<br>Food security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food available, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality from anywhere and there is no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food insecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to calamity or disaster. Although a large section of people suffer from food and nutrition insecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households in rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers engaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are disproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically backward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions more prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of the society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is composed of two components: buffer stock and public distribution system.
