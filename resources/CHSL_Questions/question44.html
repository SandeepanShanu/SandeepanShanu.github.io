			In Section I, you will read about the French Revolution, the
		Russian Revolution, and the rise of Nazism. In different ways all these
		events were important in the making of the modern world.
	<br><br>
			Chapter I is on the French Revolution. Today we often take the
		ideas of liberty, freedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind
		ourselves that these ideas also have a history. By looking at the French
		Revolution you will read a small part of that history. The French
		Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A society based on
		privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration of
		the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new
		time. The idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality
		became part of a new language of politics. 
	<br><br>
			In Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in
		Europe, and the dramatic events that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar
		Nicholas II, to give up power. The chapter will tell you about the
		changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems
		it faced and the measures it undertook. While Soviet Russia pushed
		ahead with industrialisation and mechanisation of agriculture, it denied
		the rights of citizens that were essential to the working of a democratic
		society. The ideals of socialism, however, became part of the anticolonial movements in different countries. 
	<br><br>
			Chapter III will take you to Germany. It will discuss the rise of
		Hitler and the politics of Nazism. You will read about the children and
		women in Nazi Germany, about schools and concentration camps. You
		will see how Nazism denied various minorities a right to live, how it
		drew upon a long tradition of anti-Jewish feelings to persecute the Jews,
		and how it waged a relentless battle against democracy and socialism.
		But the story of Nazismâ€™s rise is not only about a few specific events,
		about massacres and killings. It is about the working of an elaborate and
		frightening system which operated at different levels.
