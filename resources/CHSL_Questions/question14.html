			Classification helps us in exploring the diversity of life forms. The 
		major characteristics considered for classifying all organisms into five 
		major kingdoms are: whether they are made of prokaryotic or eukaryotic 
		cells; whether the cells are living singly or organised into multi-cellular 
		and thus complex organisms; whether the cells have a cell wall and 
		whether they prepare their own food. All living organisms are divided on 
		the above bases into five kingdoms, namely Monera, Protista, Fungi, 
		Plantae and Animalia. The classification of life forms is related to their 
		evolution. Plantae and Animalia are further divided into subdivisions on 
		the basis of increasing complexity of body organisation. Plants are 
		divided into five groups: Thallophytes, Bryophytes, Pteridophytes, 
		Gymnosperms and Angiosperms. Animals are divided into ten groups: 
		Porifera, Coelenterata, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, 
		Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata, Protochordata and Vertebrata. 
		The binomial nomenclature makes for a uniform way of identification of 
		the vast diversity of life around us. The binomial nomenclature is made 
		up of two words - a generic name and a specific name.

			Biodiversity means the diversity of life forms. Diverse life forms 
		share the environment, and are affected by each other too. As a result, a 
		stable community of different species comes into existence. Humans 
		have played their own part in recent times in changing the balance of 
		such communities. Of course, the diversity in such communities is 
		affected by particular characteristics of land, water, climate and so on. 
		Rough estimates state that there are about ten million species on the 
		planet, although we actually know only one or two millions of them. The 
		warm and humid tropical regions of the earth, between the tropic of 
		Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn, are rich in diversity of plant and 
		animal life. This is called the region of megadiversity. Of the 
		biodiversity on the planet, more than half is concentrated in a few
		countries.
