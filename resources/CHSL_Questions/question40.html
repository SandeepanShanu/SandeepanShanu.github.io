			You may be familiar with the valley of Kashmir and the famous
		Dal Lake, the house boats and shikaras, which attract thousands of
		tourists every year. Similarly, you may have visited some other tourist
		spot near a lake and enjoyed boating, swimming and other water games.

			India has many lakes. These differ from each other in size and
		other characteristics. Most lakes are permanent; some contain water only
		during the rainy season, like the lakes in the basins of inland drainage of
		semi-arid regions. There are some lakes which are the result of the
		action of glaciers and ice sheets, while others have been formed by wind,
		river action and human activities. A meandering river across a floodplain
		forms cut-offs that later develops into ox-bow lakes. Spits and bars form
		lagoons in the coastal areas, e.g. the Chilika lake, the Pulicat lake and
		the Kolleru lake. Lakes in the region of inland drainage are sometimes
		seasonal; for example, the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which is a salt
		water lake. Its water is used for producing salt. Most of the freshwater
		lakes are in the Himalayan region. They are of glacial origin. In other
		words, they formed when glaciers dug out a basin, which was later filled
		with snowmelt. The Wular lake in Jammu and Kashmir, in contrast, is
		the result of tectonic activity. It is the largest freshwater lake in India.
		The Dal lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak and Barapani are some other
		important freshwater lakes. Apart from natural lakes, the damming of the
		rivers for the generation of hydel power has also led to the formation of
		lakes, such as Guru Gobind Sagar (Bhakra Nangal Project).

			Lakes are of great value to human beings. A lake helps to regulate
		the flow of a river. During heavy rains, it prevents flooding and during
		the dry season, it helps to maintain an even flow of water. Lakes can also
		be used for developing hydel power. They moderate the climate of the
		surroundings; maintain the aquatic ecosystem, enhance natural beauty,
		help develop tourism and provide recreation.
