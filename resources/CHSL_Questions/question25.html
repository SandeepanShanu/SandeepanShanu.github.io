			Psychological insecurity expresses as anxiety and depression and 
		in severe cases may result in psychosis, which is a mental disorder. 
		Psychologically insecure individuals may even attempt suicide.
	<br><br>
			Anxiety is not abnormal. Everyone gets the feeling of anxiety 
		sometime or the other. Anxiety is an apprehension of something 
		unpleasant or some danger. It causes mental discomfort and pain. It may 
		sometimes prove to be useful, for example, before an examination or 
		competition. But an abnormally high level of anxiety is 
		counterproductive as it distracts and lowers the span of attention. 
		Adolescents sometimes panic out of anxiety without knowing the reason. 
		They may even feel a fear of failure in future. This makes them tense 
		and tired. Anxiety may manifest as a need to get medical treatment for 
		an imaginary sleep disorder or some other physical complaint. It may 
		also manifest as over breathing (hyperventilation syndrome). Anxiety 
		may even be due to separation from parents or even for having to attend 
		school out of compulsion or due to sex drive. Adolescents may try to get 
		out of anxiety by self-help. The right treatment for anxiety lies in 
		seeking help from parents, teachers, counselors and even friends.

			Feeling ‘sad’ or low is common among the adolescents. If the 
		feeling is short-lived there is no problem. But sometimes symptoms of 
		depression show up as social withdrawal, need to weep, eating and 
		sleeping problems, and feeling of dejection and hopelessness. 
		Depression at times leads to hostility towards parents, society and peers. 
		‘Anger’ is sometimes a psychological reaction for fighting depression. If 
		an individual faces pressure, he/she should be empowered to access or 
		seek information, advice, support through appropriate communication 
		from significant adults such as the parents, teachers, elders, relatives, 
		peers, counselors and health professionals. The best way to get out of 
		depression is to engage oneself in various types of physical activities and 
		hobbies. Hope you all will have Psychological security.
