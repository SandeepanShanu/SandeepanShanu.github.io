			We all observe that when individuals fall ill or are injured, they are
		taken to hospitals or doctors for treatment. But it takes time to reach
		them, during which if some initial care is taken, it helps treatment of
		such individuals and in many cases saves their lives. We also observe
		that some of the minor illnesses or injuries are cured by taking such
		initial care. However, this care cannot be taken unless we are aware and
		trained in first-aid. In the present lesson we shall discuss various aspects
		of first aid and safety.
	<br><br>
			First aid is the provision of initial care for an illness or injury. It is
		usually performed by a non-expert person to a sick or injured person
		until appropriate medical treatment can be accessed in a hospital or by
		going to a doctor. Certain self-limiting illnesses or minor injuries may
		not require further medical care after the first aid intervention. It
		generally consists of a series of simple and in some cases, potentially
		life-saving techniques that an individual can be trained to perform with
		minimal equipment. The First aid training, therefore, is of value in both
		preventing and treating sudden illness or accidental injury and in caring
		for large number of persons caught in a natural disaster. It is a measure
		both for self help as well as for the help of others. If you, as a first-aider,
		are prepared to help others, you are better able to care for yourself in
		case of injury or sudden illness. Even if your own condition keeps you
		from caring for yourself, you can direct others in carrying out correct
		procedures to follow on your behalf.
	<br><br>
			The main objective of first aid is not to cure, but to ensure safety
		until the patient or affected person accesses specialised treatment. It is
		the initial assistance or care of a suddenly sick or injured person. It is the
		care administered by a person as soon as possible after an illness or
		accident. It is this prompt care and attention prior to the arrival of the
		ambulance that sometimes creates the difference between life and death,
		or between a full or partial recovery.
