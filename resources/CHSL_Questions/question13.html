		In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions. For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multicellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialized to carry out specific functions. Each specialized function is taken up by a different group of cells. Since these cells carry out only a particular function, they do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour. Cells specializing in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function.
		Tissue is a group of cells similar in structure and function. Plant tissues are of two main types â€“ meristematic and permanent. Meristematic tissue is the dividing tissue present in the growing regions of the plant. Permanent tissues are derived from meristematic tissue once they lose the ability to divide. Parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma are three types of simple tissues. Animal tissues can be epithelial, connective, muscular and nervous tissue. Depending on shape and function of the tissue, epithelial tissue is classified as squamous, cuboidal, columnar, ciliated and glandular. There are three types of muscle tissues and 6 types of connective tissues.
