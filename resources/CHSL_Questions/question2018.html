		Water purification, process by which undesired chemical compounds, organic and inorganic materials, and biological contaminants are removed from water. That process also includes distillation and deionization. One major purpose of water purification is to provide clean drinking water. Water purification also meets the needs of medical, pharmacological, chemical, and industrial applications for clean and potable water. The purification procedure reduces the concentration of contaminants such as suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses, and fungi. Water purification takes place on scales from the large to the small. Water from inlets located in the water supply, such as a lake, is sent to the mixed, coagulated, and flocculated and is then sent to the waterworks for purification by filtering and chemical treatment. After being treated it is pumped into water mains for storage or distribution. Most communities rely on natural bodies of water as intake sources for water purification and for day to day use. In general, these resources can be classified as groundwater or surface water and commonly includes underground aquifers, creeks, streams, rivers, and lakes. With recent technological advancements, oceans and saltwater seas have also been used as alternative water sources for drinking and domestic use. Historical evidence suggests that water treatment was recognized and practiced by ancient civilizations. Basic treatment for water purification have been documented in Greek and Sanskrit writings, and Egyptians used alum for precipitation as early as fifteen hundred BCE. In modern times, the quality to which water must be purified is typically set by government agencies. Whether set locally, nationally, or internationally, government standards typically set maximum concentrations of harmful contaminants that can be allowed in safe water. Since it is nearly impossible to examine water simply on the basis of appearance, multiple processes, such as physical, chemical, or biological analyses.
