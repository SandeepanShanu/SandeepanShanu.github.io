			I will begin with Bruno, my wife’s pet sloth bear. I got him for her
		by accident. Two years ago we were passing through the sugarcane
		fields near Mysore. People were driving away the wild pigs from the
		fields by shooting at them. Some were shot and some escaped. We
		thought that everything was over when suddenly a black sloth bear came
		out panting in the hot sun. Now I will not shoot a sloth bear wantonly
		but, unfortunately for the poor beast, one of my companions did not feel
		that way about it, and promptly shot the bear on the spot.
	<br><br>
			As we watched the fallen animal we were surprised to see that the
		black fur on its back moved and left the prostrate body. Then we saw it
		was a baby bear that had been riding on its mother’s back when the
		sudden shot had killed her. The little creature ran around its prostrate
		parent making a pitiful noise. I ran up to it to attempt a capture. It
		scooted into the sugarcane field. Following it with my companions, I
		was at last able to grab it by the scruff of its neck while it snapped and
		tried to scratch me with its long, hooked claws
	<br><br>
			We put it in one of the gunny-bags we had brought and when I got
		back to Bangalore I duly presented it to my wife. She was delighted! She
		at once put a coloured ribbon around its neck, and after discovering the
		cub was a ‘boy’ she christened it Bruno. Bruno soon took to drinking
		milk from a bottle. It was but a step further and within a very few days
		he started eating and drinking everything else. And everything is the
		right word, for he ate porridge made from any ingredients, vegetables,
		fruit, nuts, meat (especially pork), curry and rice regardless of
		condiments and chillies, bread, eggs, chocolates, sweets, pudding, icecream, etc., etc., etc. As for drink: milk, tea, coffee, lime-juice, aerated
		water, buttermilk, beer, alcoholic liquor and, in fact, anything liquid. It
		all went down with relish. The bear became very attached to our two
		Alsatian dogs and to all the children of the tenants living in our
		bungalow.
