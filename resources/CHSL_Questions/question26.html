			As we know, education, particularly school education, aims at the 
		holistic development of children. It provides students with opportunities 
		to grow and develop as adults to be useful for the society. It is important 
		for us to know that one of the most important requirements for growing 
		into healthy adulthood is the physical growth which supports cognitive 
		development. It is, therefore, necessary that all children get adequate
		opportunity to participate in free play, informal and formal games, sports 
		and yoga activities. It is in this context that health has been made a 
		significant component of the subject of Physical Education in the school 
		education system of the country. The subject “Health and Physical 
		Education” adopts a holistic definition of health within which physical 
		education and yoga contribute to the physical, social, emotional and 
		mental development of a child.

			In view of the above, the meaning of physical education becomes a 
		little different from what is commonly understood. Physical education 
		comprises holistic education for the development of personality of the 
		child to its fullest and perfection in body, mind and spirit through 
		engaging in regular physical activities. Physical education through the 
		medium of physical activities helps individuals to attain and maintain 
		physical fitness. It contributes to physical efficiency, mental alertness 
		and the development of qualities like perseverance, team spirit, 
		leadership and obedience to rules. It develops personal and social skills 
		among the learners and makes a positive impact on their physical, social, 
		emotional and mental development. It also contributes to the total health 
		of learners and the community. Physical education thus, can be defined 
		as a subject that is not only focused on physical fitness but is also 
		concerned with development of a number of skills, abilities and attitudes 
		for leading a healthy lifestyle. It inculcates values like cooperation, 
		respect to others, loyalty, self-confidence, winning with grace and losing 
		with hope.
