			Everyday we come across a lot of information in the form of facts, 
		numerical figures, tables, graphs, etc. These are provided by newspapers, 
		televisions, magazines and other means of communication. These may 
		relate to cricket batting or bowling averages, profits of a company, 
		temperatures of cities, expenditures in various sectors of a five year plan, 
		polling results, and so on. These facts or figures, which are numerical or 
		otherwise, collected with a definite purpose are called data. Data is the 
		plural form of the Latin word datum. Of course, the word ‘data’ is not 
		new for you. You have studied about data and data handling in earlier 
		classes. Our world is becoming more and more information oriented. 
		Every part of our lives utilises data in one form or the other. So, it 
		becomes essential for us to know how to extract meaningful information 
		from such data. This extraction of meaningful information is studied in a 
		branch of mathematics called Statistics.

			The word ‘statistics’ appears to have been derived from the Latin 
		word ‘status’ meaning ‘a (political) state’. In its origin, statistics was 
		simply the collection of data on different aspects of the life of people, 
		useful to the State. Over the period of time, however, its scope 
		broadened and statistics began to concern itself not only with the 
		collection and presentation of data but also with the interpretation and 
		drawing of inferences from the data. Statistics deals with collection, 
		organisation, analysis and interpretation of data. The word ‘statistics’ 
		has different meanings in different contexts. First, statistics is used in a 
		plural sense, meaning numerical data. These may include a number of 
		educational institutions of India, literacy rates of various states, etc. 
		Second, the word ‘statistics’ is used as a singular noun, meaning the 
		subject which deals with the collection, presentation, analysis of data as 
		well as drawing of meaningful conclusions from the data. In this chapter, 
		we shall briefly discuss all these aspects regarding data.
