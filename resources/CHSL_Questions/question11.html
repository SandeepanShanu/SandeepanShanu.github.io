		During a chemical reaction, the sum of the masses of the reactants and products remains unchanged. This is known as the Law of Conservation of Mass. In a pure chemical compound, elements are always present in a definite proportion by mass. This is known as the Law of Definite Proportions. An atom is the smallest particle of the element that cannot usually exist independently and retain all its chemical properties. Scientists use the relative atomic mass scale to compare the masses of different atoms of elements. Atoms of carbon-12isotopes are assigned a relative atomic mass of 12 and the relative masses of all other atoms are obtained by comparison with the mass of acarbon-12 atom. Atoms of most elements are not able to exist independently.
		<br>A molecule is the smallest particle of an element or a compound capable of independent existence under ordinary conditions. It shows all the properties of the substance. Compounds composed of metals and nonmetals contain charged species. The charged species are known as ions. Ions may consist of a single charged atom or a group of atoms that have a net charge on them. An ion can be negatively or positively charged. A negatively charged ion is called an "anion" and the positively charged ion, "a cation". In ionic compounds, the charge on each ion is used to determine the chemical formula of the compound. Clusters of atoms that act as an ion are called polyatomic ions. They carry a fixed charge on them. The combining capacity of an element is known as its valency. Valency can be used to find out how the atoms of an element will combine with the atoms of another element to form a chemical compound. The valency of the atom of an element, can to an extent, be thought of as hands or arms of that atom
