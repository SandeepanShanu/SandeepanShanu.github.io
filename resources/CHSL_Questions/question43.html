			Like its flora, India is also rich in its fauna. It has approximately
		90,000 animal species. The country has about 2,000 species of birds.
		They constitute 13% of the world’s total. There are 2,546 species of fish,
		which account for nearly 12% of the world’s stock. It also shares
		between 5 and 8 per cent of the world’s amphibians, reptiles and
		mammals. The elephants are the most majestic animals among the
		mammals. They are found in the hot wet forests of Assam, Karnataka
		and Kerala. One-horned rhinoceroses are the other animals, which live in
		swampy and marshy lands of Assam and West Bengal. Arid areas of the
		Rann of Kachchh and the Thar Desert are the habitat for wild ass and
		camels respectively. Indian bison, nilgai (blue bull), chousingha (fourhorned antelope), gazel and different species of deer are some other
		animals found in India. It also has several species of monkeys.

			The Himalayas harbour a hardy range of animals, which survive in
		extreme cold. Ladakh’s freezing high altitudes are a home to yak, the
		shaggy horned wild ox weighing around one tonne, the Tibetan antelope,
		the bharal (blue sheep), wild sheep, and the kiang (Tibetan wild ass).
		Furthermore, the ibex, bear, snow-leopard and rare red panda are found
		in certain pockets. In the rivers, lakes and coastal areas, turtles,
		crocodiles and gharials are found. The latter is the only representative of
		a variety of crocodile, found in the world today. Bird life in India is
		colourful. Peacocks, pheasants, ducks, parakeets, cranes and pigeons are
		some of the birds inhabiting the forests and wetlands of the country.

			India is the only country in the world that has both tigers and lions.
		The natural habitat of the Indian lion is the Gir forest in Gujarat. Tigers
		are found in the forests of Madhya Pradesh, the Sundarbans of West
		Bengal and the Himalayan region. Leopards, too, are members of the cat
		family. They are important among animals of prey. To protect the flora
		and fauna of the country, the government has taken many steps.
