			All this leads to a simple conclusion: elections in India are 
		basically free and fair. The party that wins an election and forms 
		government does so because people have chosen it over its rivals. This 
		may not be true for every constituency. A few candidates may win 
		purely on the basis of money power and unfair means. But the overall 
		verdict of a general election still reflects popular preference. There are 
		very few exceptions to this rule in the last 60 years in our country. This 
		is what makes Indian elections democratic.
	<br><br>
			Yet the picture looks different if we ask deeper questions: Are 
		people’s preferences based on real knowledge? Are the voters getting a 
		real choice? Is election really level playing field for everyone? Can an 
		ordinary citizen hope to win elections? Questions of this kind bring the 
		many limitations and challenges of Indian elections to our attention. 
		These include:
	<br><br>
			Candidates and parties with a lot of money may not be sure of 
		their victory but they do enjoy a big and unfair advantage over smaller 
		parties and independents. In some parts of the country, candidates with 
		criminal connection have been able to push others out of the electoral 
		race and to secure a ‘ticket’ from major parties. Some families tend to 
		dominate political parties; tickets are distributed to relatives from these 
		families. Very often elections offer little choice to ordinary citizens, for 
		both the major parties are quite similar to each other both in policies and 
		practice. Smaller parties and independent candidates suffer a huge 
		disadvantage compared to bigger parties.
	<br><br>
			These challenges exist not just in India but also in many 
		established democracies. These deeper issues are a matter of concern for 
		those who believe in democracy. That is why citizens, social activists 
		and organisations have been demanding reforms in our electoral system. 
		Can you think of some reforms? What can an ordinary citizen do to face 
		these challenges? In this chapter we will see the answer of all these 
		questions.
