			The Indian landmass has a central location between the East and
		the West Asia. India is a southward extension of the Asian continent.
		The trans Indian Ocean routes, which connect the countries of Europe in
		the West and the countries of East Asia, provide a strategic central
		location to India. Note that the Deccan Peninsula protrudes into the
		Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with West
		Asia, Africa and Europe from the western coast and with Southeast and
		East Asia from the eastern coast. No other country has a long coastline
		on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is India’s eminent
		position in the Indian Ocean, which justifies the naming of an Ocean
		after it

			India’s contacts with the World have continued through ages but
		her relationships through the land routes are much older than her
		maritime contacts. The various passes across the mountains in the north
		have provided passages to the ancient travellers, while the oceans
		restricted such interaction for a long time. These routes have contributed
		in the exchange of ideas and commodities since ancient times. The ideas
		of the Upanishads and the Ramayana, the stories of Panchtantra, the
		Indian numerals and the decimal system thus could reach many parts of
		the world. The spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from
		India to different countries. On the other hand, the influence of Greek
		sculpture, and the architectural styles of dome and minarets from West
		Asia can be seen in different parts of our country.

			India shares its land boundaries with Pakistan and Afghanistan in
		the northwest, China (Tibet), Nepal and Bhutan in the north and
		Myanmar and Bangladesh in the east. Our southern neighbours across
		the sea consist of the two island countries, namely Sri Lanka and
		Maldives. Sri Lanka is separated from India by a narrow channel of sea
		formed by the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar, while Maldives
		Islands are situated to the south of the Lakshadweep Islands. India has
		had strong geographical and historical links with her neighbours.
