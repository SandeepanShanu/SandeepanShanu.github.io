			The word ‘geometry’ comes from the Greek words ‘geo’, meaning 
		the ‘earth’, and ‘metrein’, meaning ‘to measure’. Geometry appears to 
		have originated from the need for measuring land. This branch of 
		mathematics was studied in various forms in every ancient civilisation, 
		be it in Egypt, Babylonia, China, India, Greece, the Incas, etc. The 
		people of these civilisations faced several practical problems which 
		required the development of geometry in various ways.

			For example, whenever the river Nile overflowed, it wiped out the 
		boundaries between the adjoining fields of different land owners. After 
		such flooding, these boundaries had to be redrawn. For this purpose, the 
		Egyptians developed a number of geometric techniques and rules for 
		calculating simple areas and also for doing simple constructions. The 
		knowledge of geometry was also used by them for computing volumes 
		of granaries, and for constructing canals and pyramids. They also knew 
		the correct formula to find the volume of a truncated pyramid. You 
		know that a pyramid is a solid figure, the base of which is a triangle, or 
		square, or some other polygon, and its side faces are triangles
		converging to a point at the top.

			In the Indian subcontinent, the excavations at Harappa and 
		Mohenjo-Daro, etc. show that the Indus Valley Civilisation (about 3000 
		BCE) made extensive use of geometry. It was a highly organised 
		society. The cities were highly developed and very well planned. For 
		example, the roads were parallel to each other and there was an 
		underground drainage system. The houses had many rooms of different 
		types. This shows that the town dwellers were skilled in mensuration and 
		practical arithmetic. The bricks used for constructions were kiln fired 
		and the ratio length:breadth:thickness, of the bricks was found to be 
		4:2:1. In ancient India, the Sulbasutras (800 BCE to 500 BCE) were the 
		manuals of geometrical constructions. The geometry of the Vedic period 
		originated with the construction of altars (or vedis) and fireplaces for 
		performing Vedic rites.
