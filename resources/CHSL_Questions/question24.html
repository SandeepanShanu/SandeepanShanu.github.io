			Growth and development during adolescence do affect self-concept 
		and self-esteem. The concept of ‘self’ becomes evident in boys 
		and girls as they enter their ‘teen’ age. Several changes begin to occur in 
		their body and psyche. As a result, the attention is focused towards 
		‘self’. As the concept of ‘self’ develops, it makes the teenager develop 
		less dependence on parents. Self-image becomes important not only for 
		oneself but also in the eyes of others. Grooming oneself to look beautiful 
		or handsome to others is always at the back of the mind of young boys 
		and girls. Support and guidance from parents and teachers and friendship 
		with peers help in developing ‘positive self-esteem’. Self-esteem is also 
		a kind of self-recognition. The consequences of low self-esteem and 
		self-image are detrimental to efficiency. Try to have high self-esteem 
		and a positive self-image.

			For developing self-confidence and self-esteem, it is essential to 
		have a stress-free environment. Adolescence is a period of losses i.e. loss 
		of childhood, loss of sexual innocence, loss of freedom from 
		responsibility. Adolescents need parental support to cope with these 
		losses. Psychological security depends a lot on how a boy or girl was 
		valued by the family as a child. You may have seen that teenagers who 
		have experienced encouragement from others with respect to values and 
		parental expectations tend to be psychologically more secure than those 
		who are subjected as children to shame and punishment. A 
		psychologically secure teenager is able to concentrate on studies, have 
		respect for parents, spend time judiciously on hobbies and establish 
		healthy relationships. Adolescence has to be viewed as a period of gains 
		too. The adolescent attains a beautiful physique, figure and face. 
		Another gain is the maturity of brain, which leads to rational thinking 
		and better understanding of subjects and issues. But to ignore the losses 
		and carry the gains forward, support from parents/guardians, teachers, 
		and peers goes a long way in helping the youngsters cope with changes 
		occurring during adolescence.
