			In Section II we will shift our focus to the study of livelihoods and
		economies. We will look at how the lives of forest dwellers and
		pastoralists changed in the modern world and how they played a part in
		shaping these changes. All too often in looking at the emergence of the
		modern world, we only focus on factories and cities, on the industrial
		and agricultural sectors which supply the market.
	<br><br>
			But we forget that there are other economies outside these sectors,
		other people too who matter to the nation. To modern eyes, the lives of
		pastoralists and forest dwellers, the shifting cultivators and food
		gatherers often seem to be stuck in the past. It is as if their lives are not
		important when we study the emergence of the contemporary world. The
		chapters in Section II will suggest that we need to know about their
		lives, see how they organise their world and operate their economies.
		These communities are very much part of the modern world we live in
		today. They are not simply survivors from a bygone era. We cannot
		understand the making of the contemporary world unless we begin to see
		the changes in the lives of diverse communities and people

			Chapter IV will take you into the forest and tell you about the
		variety of ways the forests were used by communities living within
		them. It will show how in the nineteenth century the growth of industries
		and urban centres, ships and railways, created a new demand on the
		forests for timber and other forest products. New demands led to new
		rules of forest use, new ways of organising the forest. You will see how
		colonial control was established over the forests, how forest areas were
		mapped, trees were classified, and plantations were developed. All these
		developments affected the lives of those local communities who used
		forest resources. They were forced to operate within new systems and
		reorganise their lives. But they also rebelled against the rules and
		persuaded the state to change its policies. The chapter will give you an
		idea of the history of such developments in India and Indonesia.
