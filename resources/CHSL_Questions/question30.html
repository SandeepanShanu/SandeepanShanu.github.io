			Warming up is usually performed before participating in any games and 
		sports and physical activities. It is important to keep oneself free from 
		injury, pain and how to avoid fatigue. While warming up prepares your 
		body for intense exercise, whereas cooling down helps bring it back to 
		near normal after rigorous activity.

			Warming Up: Muscle stiffness is thought to be directly related to 
		muscle injury and therefore, the warming up should be aimed at 
		reducing muscle stiffness. Warming up should consist of a gradual 
		increase in physical activity for individuals for increasing joint mobility, 
		stretching and various ways of sports related activities. One should 
		warm-up approximate 8-12 minutes or per specific requirements which 
		include running, stretching of wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck, trunk, hip, 
		knees, ankles joints.

			Cooling Down: Once you are through with the workout and you 
		reach the end of the game, it is equally important to ensure that the body 
		cools down. Cooling down should ideally consist of: five to ten minute 
		walk or light jog as it cools down the body temperature and relaxes the 
		muscles; about ten minutes of static stretching exercises that include 
		chest stretch, biceps stretch, hamstring stretch, calf stretch, hip and thigh 
		stretch, front of trunk stretch and quadriceps stretch. Each stretch should 
		not take more than 10 to 30 seconds. Intensity and duration of warming 
		up and cooling down should vary according to the nature of workout or 
		game. The more rigorous the workout or game, the more rigorous should 
		be the warm up and cool down.

		intensity dynamic exercise and static stretch performed to gradually
