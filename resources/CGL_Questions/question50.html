			I was born into a middle-class Tamil family in the island town of 
		Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras State. My father, Jainulabdeen, 
		had neither much formal education nor much wealth; despite these 
		disadvantages, he possessed great innate wisdom and a true generosity 
		of spirit. He had an ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. I do not 
		recall the exact number of people she fed every day, but I am quite 
		certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the members of our 
		own family put together.

			I was one of many children i.e. a short boy with rather 
		undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents. We lived in 
		our ancestral house, which was built in the middle of the nineteenth 
		century. It was a fairly large pucca house, made of limestone and brick, 
		on the Mosque Street in Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid 
		all inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities were 
		provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. In fact, I would say 
		mine was a very secure childhood, both materially and emotionally.

			The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was eight years 
		old. For reasons I have never been able to understand, a sudden demand 
		for tamarind seeds erupted in the market. I used to collect the seeds and 
		sell them to a provision shop on Mosque Street. A dayâ€™s collection 
		would fetch me the princely sum of one anna. My brother-in-law 
		Jallaluddin would tell me stories about the War which I would later 
		attempt to trace in the headlines in Dinamani. Our area, being isolated, 
		was completely unaffected by the War. But soon India was forced to join 
		the Allied Forces and something like a state of emergency was declared. 
		The first casualty came in the form of the suspension of the train halt at 
		Rameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be bundled and 
		thrown out from the moving train on the Rameswaram Road between 
		Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi. That forced my cousin Samsuddin, who 
		distributed newspapers in Rameswarm, to look for a helping hand to 
		catch the bundles and, as if naturally, I filled the slot.
