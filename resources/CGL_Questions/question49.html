			Rush hour crowds jostle for position on the underground train 
		platform. A slight girl, looking younger than her seventeen years, was 
		nervous yet excited as she felt the vibrations of the approaching train. It 
		was her first day at the prestigious Royal Academy of Music in London 
		and daunting enough for any teenager fresh from a Scottish farm. But 
		this aspiring musician faced a bigger challenge than most: she was 
		profoundly deaf.

			Evelyn Glennie’s loss of hearing had been gradual. Her mother 
		remembers noticing something was wrong when the eight-year-old 
		Evelyn was waiting to play the piano. “They called her name and she 
		didn’t move. I suddenly realised she hadn’t heard,” says Isabel Glennie. 
		For quite a while Evelyn managed to conceal her growing deafness from 
		friends and teachers. But by the time she was eleven her marks had 
		deteriorated and her headmistress urged her parents to take her to a 
		specialist. It was then discovered that her hearing was severely impaired 
		as a result of gradual nerve damage. They were advised that she should 
		be fitted with hearing aids and sent to a school for the deaf. “Everything 
		suddenly looked black.” says Evelyn.

			But Evelyn was not going to give up. She was determined to lead a 
		normal life and pursue her interest in music. One day she noticed a girl 
		playing a xylophone and decided that she wanted to play it too. Most of 
		the teachers discouraged her but percussionist Ron Forbes spotted her 
		potential. He began by tuning two large drums to different notes. “Don’t 
		listen through your ears,” he would say, “try to sense it some other way.” 
		Says Evelyn, “Suddenly I realised I could feel the higher drum from the 
		waist up and the lower one from the waist down.” Forbes repeated the 
		exercise, and soon Evelyn discovered that she could sense certain notes 
		in different parts of her body. “I had learnt to open my mind and body to 
		sounds and vibrations.” The rest was sheer determination and hard work.
		By the time she was sixteen, she had decided to make music her life.
