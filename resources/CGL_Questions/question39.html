			The term drainage describes the river system of an area. Look at
		the physical map. You will notice that small streams flowing from
		different directions come together to form the main river, which
		ultimately drains into a large water body such as a lake or a sea or an
		ocean. The area drained by a single river system is called a drainage
		basin. A closer observation on a map will indicate that any elevated area,
		such as a mountain or an upland, separates two drainage basins. Such an
		upland is known as a water divide
	<br><br>
			The drainage systems of India are mainly controlled by the broad
		relief features of the subcontinent. Accordingly, the Indian rivers are
		divided into two major groups: the Himalayan rivers; and the Peninsular
		rivers.
	<br><br>
			Apart from originating from the two major physiographic regions
		of India, the Himalayan and the Peninsular rivers are different from each
		other in many ways. Most of the Himalayan rivers are perennial. It
		means that they have water throughout the year. These rivers receive
		water from rain as well as from melted snow from the lofty mountains.
		The two major Himalayan rivers, the Indus and the Brahmaputra
		originate from the north of the mountain ranges. They have cut through
		the mountains making gorges. The Himalayan rivers have long courses
		from their source to the sea
	<br><br>
			They perform intensive erosional activity in their upper courses
		and carry huge loads of silt and sand. In the middle and the lower
		courses, these rivers form meanders, oxbow lakes, and many other
		depositional features in their floodplains. They also have well developed
		deltas.
	<br><br>
			A large number of the Peninsular rivers are seasonal, as their flow
		is dependent on rainfall. During the dry season, even the large rivers
		have reduced flow of water in their channels. The Peninsular rivers have
		shorter and shallower courses as compared to their Himalayan
		counterparts. However, some of them originate in the central highlands
		and flow towards the west. Most of the rivers of peninsular India
		originate in the Western Ghats and flow towards the Bay of Bengal.
