			Can politics change the clothes people wear, the language they
		speak or the books they read? The years following 1789 in France saw
		many such changes in the lives of men, women and children. The
		revolutionary governments took it upon themselves to pass laws that
		would translate the ideals of liberty and equality into everyday practice.
		One important law that came into effect soon after the storming of the
		Bastille in the summer of 1789 was the abolition of censorship. In the
		Old Regime all written material and cultural activities books,
		newspapers, plays - could be published or performed only after they had
		been approved by the censors of the king. Now the Declaration of the
		Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed freedom of speech and expression
		to be a natural right. Newspapers, pamphlets, books and printed pictures
		flooded the towns of France from where they travelled rapidly into the
		countryside. They all described and discussed the events and changes
		taking place in France. Freedom of the press also meant that opposing
		views of events could be expressed. Each side sought to convince the
		others of its position through the medium of print. Plays, songs and
		festive processions attracted large numbers of people. This was one way
		they could grasp and identify with ideas such as liberty or justice that
		political philosophers wrote about at length in texts which only a handful
		of educated people could read.

			The ideas of liberty and democratic rights were the most important
		legacy of the French Revolution. These spread from France to the rest of
		Europe during the nineteenth century, where feudal systems were
		abolished. Colonised peoples reworked the idea of freedom from
		bondage into their movements to create a sovereign nation state. Tipu
		Sultan and Rammohan Roy are two examples of individuals who
		responded to the ideas coming from revolutionary France. Raja
		Rammohan Roy was one of those who was inspired by new ideas that
		were spreading through Europe at that time. The French Revolution and
		later, the July Revolution excited his imagination.
