			Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and
		variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty
		years). Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere over an area at any
		point of time. The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e.
		temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation.
		You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often
		even within a day. But there is some common pattern over a few weeks
		or months, i.e. days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy or bright, and
		wet or dry
	<br><br>
			There are six major controls of the climate of any place. They are:
		latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea
		(continentality), ocean currents and relief features. Due to the curvature
		of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to
		latitude. As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the
		equator towards the poles. As one goes from the surface of the earth to
		higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature
		decreases. The hills are therefore cooler during summers. The pressure
		and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the
		place. Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern. The sea
		exerts a moderating influence on climate: As the distance from the sea
		increases, its moderating influence decreases and the people experience
		extreme weather conditions. This condition is known as continentality
		(i.e. very hot during summers and very cold during winters). Ocean
		currents along with onshore winds affect the climate of the coastal areas,
		For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past it,
		will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore. Finally, relief too
		plays a major role in determining the climate of a place. High mountains
		act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may also cause precipitation if
		they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The
		leeward side of mountains remains relatively dry.
