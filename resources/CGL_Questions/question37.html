			The Peninsular plateau is a tableland composed of the old
		crystalline, igneous and metamorphic rocks. It is formed due to the
		breaking and drifting of the Gondwana land and thus, making it a part of
		the oldest landmass. The plateau has broad and shallow valleys and
		rounded hills. This plateau consists of two broad divisions, namely, the
		Central Highlands and the Deccan Plateau. The part of the Peninsular
		plateau lying to the north of the Narmada river, covering a major area of
		the Malwa plateau, is known as the Central Highlands. The Vindhyan
		range is bounded by the Satpura range on the south and the Aravalis on
		the northwest. The further westward extension gradually merges with the
		sandy and rocky desert of Rajasthan. The flow of the rivers draining this
		region, namely the Chambal, the Sind, the Betwa and the Ken is from
		southwest to northeast, thus indicating the slope. The Central Highlands
		are wider in the west but narrower in the east. The eastward extensions
		of this plateau are locally known as the Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand.
		The Chotanagpur plateau marks he further eastward extension, drained
		by the Damodar river.

			The Deccan Plateau is a triangular landmass that lies to the south
		of the river Narmada. The Satpura range flanks its broad base in the
		north, while the Mahadev, the Kaimur hills and the Maikal range form
		its eastern extensions. Locate these hills and ranges in the Physical map
		of India. The Deccan Plateau is higher in the west and slopes gently
		eastwards. An extension of the Plateau is also visible in the northeast,
		locally known as the Meghalaya, Karbi-Anglong Plateau and North
		Cachar Hills. It is separated by a fault from the Chotanagpur Plateau.
		Threeprominent hill ranges from the west to the east are the Garo, the
		Khasi and the Jaintia Hills. The Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats
		mark the western and the eastern edges of the Deccan Plateau
		respectively. Western Ghats lie parallel to the western coast. They are
		continuous and can be crossed through passes only.
