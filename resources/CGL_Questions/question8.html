		How do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter, salt, spices, mineral water or juice that we buy from the market are pure? Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ written on the packs of these consumables? For a common person pure means having no adulteration. But, for a scientist all these things are actually mixtures of different substances and hence not pure. For example, milk is actually a mixture of water, fat, proteins etc. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that all the constituent particles of that substance are the same in their chemical nature. A pure substance consists of a single type of particle. In other words, a substance is a pure single form of matter. As we look around, we can see that most of the matter around us exist as mixtures of two or more pure components. For example: sea water, minerals, soil etc. are all mixtures.
		<br>Mixtures are constituted by more than one kind of pure form of matter. We know that dissolved sodium chloride can be separated from water by the physical process of evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself a pure substance and cannot be separated by physical process into its chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure substances. Whatever the source of a pure substance may be, it will always have the same characteristic properties. Therefore, we can say that a mixture contains more than one pure substance.
		<br>Based on the composition, mixture can be defined as homogeneous mixture and heterogeneous mixture. A mixture in which its constituents are distributed uniformly is called homogeneous mixture, such as salt in water. A mixture in which its constituents are not distributed uniformly is called heterogeneous mixture, such as sand in water. Based on the particle size of the component, mixture are further classified into solution, a suspension and a colloid. We will see these in the next exercise.
