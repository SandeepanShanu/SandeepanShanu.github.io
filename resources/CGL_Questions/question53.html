			I get a cheap room in the centre of town and sleep for hours. The
		next morning, with Mr Shah’s son and nephew, I visit the two temples in
		Kathmandu that are most sacred to Hindus and Buddhists. At
		Pashupatinath (outside which a sign proclaims ‘Entrance for the Hindus
		only’) there is an atmosphere of ‘febrile confusion’. Priests, hawkers,
		devotees, tourists, cows, monkeys, pigeons and dogs roam through the
		grounds. We offer a few flowers. There are so many worshippers that
		some people trying to get the priest’s attention are elbowed aside by
		others pushing their way to the front. A princess of the Nepalese royal
		house appears; everyone bows and makes way. By the main gate, a party
		of saffron-clad Westerners struggle for permission to enter. The
		policeman is not convinced that they are ‘the Hindus’ (only Hindus are
		allowed to enter the temple). A fight breaks out between two monkeys.
		One chases the other, who jumps onto a shivalinga, then runs screaming
		around the temples and down to the river, the holy Bagmati, that flows
		below. A corpse is being cremated on its banks; washerwomen are at
		their work and children bathe. From a balcony a basket of flowers and
		leaves, old offerings now wilted, is dropped into the river. A small
		shrine half protrudes from the stone platform on the river bank. When it
		emerges fully, the goddess inside will escape, and the evil period of the
		Kaliyug will end on earth.

			At the Baudhnath stupa, the Buddhist shrine of Kathmandu, there
		is, in contrast, a sense of stillness. Its immense white dome is ringed by a
		road. Small shops stand on its outer edge: many of these are owned by
		Tibetan immigrants; felt bags, Tibetan prints and silver jewellery can be
		bought here. There are no crowds: this is a haven of quietness in the
		busy streets around. Kathmandu is vivid, mercenary, religious, with
		small shrines to flower-adorned deities along the narrowest and busiest
		streets; with fruit sellers, flute sellers, hawkers of postcards; shops
		selling Western cosmetics, film rolls and chocolate; or copper utensils
		and Nepalese antiques.
