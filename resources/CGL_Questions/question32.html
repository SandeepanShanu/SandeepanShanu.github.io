			The garbage that we generate every day has not only increased in
		volume phenomenally, but has also changed its composition due to
		changes in our lifestyles and consumption patterns. For instance, there is
		now an increasing use of non-biodegradable materials such as plastics,
		metals and glass, specifically in urban areas. Technological advancement
		has further brought in an increasing use of electronic items and gadgets.
		These are useful for us, but when discarded (known as E-Waste) they
		can be harmful to the environment and human health, particularly for the
		workers associated with this occupation.
	<br><br>
			In addition, we seem to have lost our aesthetic and civic sense, and
		carelessly litter garbage around on the roads, in the market-place, in
		open drains, ponds, rivers, seas, and so on. In fact, we keep throwing a
		lot of garbage every day. Have you ever thought what will happen if the
		garbage is not removed from our homes and surroundings? Where does
		this garbage ultimately go and what is done with it? If proper measures
		for disposal and sanitation are not followed, how will garbage affect our
		environment and health?
	<br><br>
			Open and unattended garbage is a common sight in the market,
		streets or in the vicinity of our homes. Most often, it emits such a foul
		smell that we have to cover our noses with a cloth. Have you ever
		stopped to think how unattended garbage can affect our health and our
		environment? If you observe carefully, you will notice that when
		garbage is allowed to collect in the open for a long time, it attracts flies,
		cockroaches and other insects. It also attracts rats and stray dogs. In fact,
		moist or fermenting garbage, particularly when organic waste such as
		kitchen waste is thrown, becomes a perfect breeding place for flies.
		When we eat the food, which has been contaminated by these flies, we
		are likely to fall ill. Water and food borne diseases such as dysentery,
		cholera and gastroenteritis are some of the diseases that can be
		transmitted by flies. Moreover, since accumulated garbage emits foul
		smell, it also causes air pollution.
