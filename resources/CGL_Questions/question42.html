			The major types of vegetation may be identified in our country
		are: Tropical Evergreen Forests; Tropical Deciduous Forests; Tropical
		Thorn Forests and Scrubs; Montane Forests; Mangrove Forests.
	<br><br>
			Tropical Evergreen Forests: These forests are restricted to heavy
		rainfall areas of the Western Ghats and the island groups of
		Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, upper parts of Assam and Tamil
		Nadu coast. They are at their best in areas having more than 200 cm of
		rainfall with a short dry season. The trees reach great heights up to 60
		metres or even above. Since the region is warm and wet throughout the
		year, it has a luxuriant vegetation of all kinds - trees, shrubs and creepers
		giving it a multilayered structure. There is no definite time for trees to
		shed their leaves. As such, these forests appear green all the year round.
		Some of the commercially important trees of this forest are ebony,
		mahogany, rosewood, rubber and cinchona. The common animals found
		in these forests are elephant, monkey, lemur and deer. One horned
		rhinoceroses are found in the jungles of Assam and West Bengal.
		Besides these animals, plenty of birds, bats, sloth, scorpions and snails
		are also found in these jungles.
	<br><br>
			Tropical Deciduous Forests: These are the most widespread forests
		of India. They are also called the monsoon forests and spread over the
		region receiving rainfall between 200 cm and 70 cm. Trees of this forest
		type shed their leaves for about six to eight weeks in dry summer. On the
		basis of the availability of water, these forests are further divided into
		moist and dry deciduous. The former is found in areas receiving rainfall
		between 200 and 100 cm. These forests exist, therefore, mostly in the
		eastern part of the country - northeastern states, along the foothills of the
		Himalayas, Jharkhand, West Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and on the
		eastern slopes of the Western Ghats. Teak is the most dominant species
		of this forest. Bamboos, sal, shisham, sandalwood, khair, kusum, arjun
		and mulberry are other commercially important species.
