			The Indian desert lies towards the western margins of the Aravali
		Hills. It is an undulating sandy plain covered with sand dunes. This
		region receives very low rainfall below 150 mm per year. It has arid
		climate with low vegetation cover. Streams appear during the rainy
		season. Soon after they disappear into the sand as they do not have
		enough water to reach the sea. Luni is the only large river in this region.
		Barchans (crescent-shaped dunes) cover larger areas but longitudinal
		dunes become more prominent near the Indo-Pakistan boundary.

			The Peninsular plateau is flanked by stretch of narrow coastal
		strips, running along the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal
		on the east. The western coast, sandwiched between the Western Ghats
		and the Arabian Sea, is a narrow plain. It consists of three sections. The
		northern part of the coast is called the Konkan (Mumbai - Goa), the
		central stretch is called the Kannad Plain, while the southern stretch is
		referred to as the Malabar coast. The plains along the Bay of Bengal are
		wide and level. In the northern part, it is referred to as the Northern
		Circar, while the southern part is known as the Coromandel Coast. Large
		rivers, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri
		have formed extensive delta on this coast. Lake Chilika is an important
		feature along the eastern coast.

			A detailed account of the different physiographic units highlights
		the unique features of each region. It would, however, be clear that each
		region complements the other and makes the country richer in its natural
		resources. The mountains are the major sources of water and forest
		wealth. The northern plains are the granaries of the country. They
		provide the base for early civilisations. The plateau is a storehouse of
		minerals, which has played a crucial role in the industrialisation of the
		country. The coastal region and island groups provide sites for fishing
		and port activities. Thus, the diverse physical features of the land have
		immense future possibilities of development.
