			Cardio-respiratory endurance reflects the ability of the bodyâ€™s 
		circulatory and respiratory systems to supply fuel during sustained 
		physical activity. To improve your cardio-respiratory endurance, try 
		activities that keep your heart rate elevated at a safe level for a sustained 
		length of time. Muscular Strength is the amount of force applied on 
		muscle or muscle groups, is able to exert for one maximal effort 
		(contraction). The key to making your muscles stronger is working them 
		against resistance, whether that be from weights or gravity. If you want 
		to gain muscle strength, try exercises such as lifting weights (under 
		proper supervision). Muscular Endurance is the ability of a muscle or 
		muscle group to exert force against a submaximal load for a given length
		of time (or number of repetition) before fatiguing to the point of failure. 
		Body Composition refers to the proportion of team body mass to body 
		fat, it includes amount of muscle, fat, bone, and other vital parts of the

		position of the body while maintaining a constant, rapid motion. Balance 
		is the ability to control or stabilize the body when a person is standing 
		still or moving. Coordination is the ability to use the senses together 
		with body parts during movement. Speed is the ability to move your 
		body or parts of your body swiftly. Many sports rely on speed to gain 
		advantage over opponents. Power is the ability to move the body parts 
		swiftly while applying the maximum force of the muscles. Power is a 
		combination of both speed and muscular strength. Reaction Time is the 
		ability to reach or respond quickly to what you hear, see or feel.
