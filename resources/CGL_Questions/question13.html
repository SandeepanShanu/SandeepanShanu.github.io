			In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions. 
	For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of 
	food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multicellular organisms 
	there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out 
	specific functions. Each specialised function is taken up by a different 
	group of cells. Since these cells carry out only a particular function, they 
	do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to 
	cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport 
	oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, 
	vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to 
	other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour. Cells 
	specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This 
	means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a 
	definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is 
	arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of 
	function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues.

		Tissue is a group of cells similar in structure and function. Plant 
	tissues are of two main types â€“ meristematic and permanent. 
	Meristematic tissue is the dividing tissue present in the growing regions 
	of the plant. Permanent tissues are derived from meristematic tissue once 
	they lose the ability to divide. They are classified as simple and complex 
	tissues. Parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma are three types of 
	simple tissues. Xylem and phloem are types of complex tissues. Animal 
	tissues can be epithelial, connective, muscular and nervous tissue. 
	Depending on shape and function, epithelial tissue is classified as 
	squamous, cuboidal, columnar, ciliated and glandular. The different 
	types of connective tissues in our body include areolar tissue, adipose 
	tissue, bone, tendon, ligament, cartilage and blood. Striated, unstriated 
	and cardiac are three types of muscle tissues.
