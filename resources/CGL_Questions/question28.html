			It is generally believed that the methodology of teaching learning is the 
		concern of teachers only. Learners have little or nothing to do with it. 
		But this is not true. The teaching and learning methods are concerns of 
		learners as well. Knowing and understanding that how different subjects 
		are taught are important for the learners of all subjects, but it has more 
		relevance for the learners of physical education. When we talk about you 
		as learners of physical education, we mean that you have actually 
		participated in the subject area, rather than merely studied it. It needs a 
		suitable learning environment and a positive will for participation. As 
		you now know, physical education does not mean organisation of a few 
		sports and games activities, involving only a selected number of 
		students, and that too occasionally. The following two paragraphs are 
		significant for the appreciation of this subject and the need for adopting 
		appropriate teaching â€“ learning methodology:
	<br><br>
			Physical education is necessary to ensure participation of all 
		children in free play, informal and formal games and sports activities. 
		All students must be involved in health and physical education activities. 
		Those who choose to excel in games and sports need to be provided 
		adequate opportunity
	<br><br>
			Involvement of all learners means that even those students need to 
		be involved, who are at the risk of marginalisation, for instance, who are 
		differently abled. Such involvement will empower them to overcome the 
		sense of helplessness, inferiority and stigma. Differences between 
		students must be viewed as resource for supporting learning rather than 
		as a problem. Inclusion in education is one of the components of 
		inclusion in society.
	<br><br>
			Various methodologies are being employed and efforts are on to 
		develop innovative teaching learning methodologies, one such 
		methodology known as PEC-India Methodology has been developed. It 
		is the outcome of a joint initiative of the British Council and the 
		Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.
