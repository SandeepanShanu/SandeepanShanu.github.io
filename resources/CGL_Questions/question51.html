			Wishing always to study “a bit more” and with her father slowly
		getting used to her urge for more education, Santosh passed the high
		school examinations and went to Jaipur. She joined Maharani College
		and got a room in Kasturba Hostel. Santosh remembers, “Kasturba
		Hostel faced the Aravalli Hills. I used to watch villagers from my room,
		going up the hill and suddenly vanishing after a while. One day I
		decided to check it out myself. I found nobody except a few
		mountaineers. I asked if I could join them. To my pleasant surprise, they
		answered in the affirmative and motivated me to take to climbing.”

			Then there was no looking back for this determined young girl.
		She saved money and enrolled in a course at Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute
		of Mountaineering. “My college semester in Jaipur was to end in April
		but it ended on the nineteenth of May. And I was supposed to be in
		Uttarkashi on the twenty-first. So, I did not go back home; instead, I
		headed straight for the training. I had to write a letter of apology to my
		father without whose permission I had got myself enrolled at
		Uttarkashi.”

			Thereafter, Santosh went on an expedition every year. Her
		climbing skills matured rapidly. Also, she developed a remarkable
		resistance to cold and the altitude. Equipped with an iron will, physical
		endurance and an amazing mental toughness, she proved herself
		repeatedly. The culmination of her hard work and sincerity came in
		1992, just four years after she had shyly asked the Aravalli mountaineers
		if she could join them. At barely twenty years of age, Santosh Yadav
		scaled Mt Everest, becoming the youngest woman in the world to
		achieve the feat. If her climbing skills, physical fitness, and mental
		strength impressed her seniors, her concern for others and desire to work
		together with them found her a special place in the hearts of fellow
		climbers. She then scaled the Everest a second time, thus setting a record
		as the only woman to have scaled the Everest twice, and securing for
		herself and India a unique place in the annals of mountaineering.
